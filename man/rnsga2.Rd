\arguments{
\item{type}{the type of genetic algorithm to be run depending on the nature
of decision variables. Possible values are:
\describe{
\item{'binary'}{for binary representations of decision variables.}
\item{'real-valued'}{for optimization problems where the decision
variables are floating-point representations of real numbers.}
\item{'permutation'}{for problems that involves reordering of a list of
objects.}
}}

\item{fitness}{the fitness function, any allowable R function which takes as
input an individual string representing a potential solution, and returns a
numerical value describing its 'fitness'.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the fitness function. This
allows to write fitness functions that keep some variables fixed during the
search}

\item{lower}{a vector of length equal to the decision variables providing the
lower bounds of the search space in case of real-valued or permutation
encoded optimizations.}

\item{upper}{a vector of length equal to the decision variables providing the
upper bounds of the search space in case of real-valued or permutation
encoded optimizations.}

\item{nBits}{a value specifying the number of bits to be used in binary
encoded optimizations}

\item{population}{an R function for randomly generating an initial population.
See \code{\link[=nsga_Population]{nsga_Population()}} for available functions.}

\item{selection}{an R function performing selection, i.e. a function which
generates a new population of individuals from the current population
probabilistically according to individual fitness. See \code{\link[=nsga_Selection]{nsga_Selection()}}
for available functions.}

\item{crossover}{an R function performing crossover, i.e. a function which
forms offsprings by combining part of the genetic information from their
parents. See \code{\link[=nsga_Crossover]{nsga_Crossover()}} for available functions.}

\item{mutation}{an R function performing mutation, i.e. a function which
randomly alters the values of some genes in a parent chromosome.
See \code{\link[=nsga_Mutation]{nsga_Mutation()}} for available functions.}

\item{reference_dirs}{Function to generate reference points using Das and
Dennis approach or matrix with supplied reference points.}

\item{epsilon}{controls the extent of obtained solutions by grouping all
solutions that have a normalized difference sum in objective values of epsilon or less.}

\item{normalization}{of the ideal points and nadir. They can be:
\describe{
\item{'ever'}{.}
\item{'front'}{.}
\item{'no'}{.}
}}

\item{extreme_points_as_ref_dirs}{flag to use extreme points as reference points.}

\item{weights}{vector specifies the importance of one objective function over
the other, by default all objectives have equal weights.}

\item{popSize}{the population size.}

\item{nObj}{number of objective in the fitness function.}

\item{pcrossover}{the probability of crossover between pairs of chromosomes.
Typically this is a large value and by default is set to 0.8.}

\item{pmutation}{the probability of mutation in a parent chromosome. Usually
mutation occurs with a small probability, and by default is set to 0.1.}

\item{maxiter}{the maximum number of iterations to run before the NSGA search
is halted.}

\item{run}{the number of consecutive generations without any improvement in
the best fitness value before the NSGA is stopped}

\item{maxFitness}{the upper bound on the fitness function after that the NSGA
search is interrupted.}

\item{names}{a vector of character strings providing the names of decision
variables.}

\item{suggestions}{a matrix of solutions strings to be included in the
initial population. If provided the number of columns must match the number
of decision variables.}

\item{parallel}{An optional argument which allows to specify if the NSGA-II
should be run sequentially or in parallel.}

\item{monitor}{a logical or an R function which takes as input the current
state of the nsga-class object and show the evolution of the search. By
default, for interactive sessions the function rmooMonitor prints the average
and best fitness values at each iteration. If set to plot these information
are plotted on a graphical device. Other functions can be written by the user
and supplied as argument. In non interactive sessions, by default
monitor = FALSE so any output is suppressed.}

\item{summary}{If there will be a summary generation after generation.}

\item{seed}{an integer value containing the random number generator state.
This argument can be used to replicate the results of a NSGA search. Note
that if parallel computing is required, the doRNG package must be installed.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class rnsga2-class. See \linkS4class{rnsga2} for a
description of available slots information.

Minimization of a fitness function using reference point based non-dominated
sorting genetic algorithms - II (R-NSGA-IIs). Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms
}
\details{
R-NSGA-II is a meta-heuristic proposed by K. Deb and J. Sundar in 2006.
It is a modification of NSGA-II based on reference points in which the
decision-maker supplies one or more preference points and a weight vector
that will guide the solutions towards regions desired by the user.
